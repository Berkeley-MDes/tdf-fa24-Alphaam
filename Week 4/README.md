## Explanation
For my mind map, I mapped out the most common devices in my ecosystem and the most frequently used applications on these devices. I created a "key" for the types of information I exchange with each platform. It was interesting thinking about how some platforms, almost purely, take information from me without actively inputting anything I interact with on my device and vice versa. It makes me think that the volume and direction of information transfer between device and application could be another variable in determining how addictive a certain platform is for certain users.
