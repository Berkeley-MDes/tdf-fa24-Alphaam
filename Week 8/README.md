### Weekly Progress Report - Week 2: Photosensor Integration and Battery Conservation

## Reflections: 
This week, I focused on integrating the photosensor to enable power control based on ambient light conditions. The goal was to use the sensor to detect whether the room light is on or off, with the system activating or deactivating accordingly to conserve battery. I configured the photosensor to interpret light levels accurately, ensuring it could reliably differentiate between day and night conditions.

The setup process involved testing various light sensitivity thresholds to prevent unintended triggering in fluctuating light. After calibration, I integrated the sensor into the enclosure, positioning it to maximize its responsiveness to room light while keeping it subtly embedded within the design. I also worked on coding the logic that powers the system on or off based on the photosensor’s input, which was tested in low-light and bright conditions to confirm reliable performance. This feature reduces battery drain significantly, aligning the device with the project’s goal of sustainable operation.

## Speculations: 
Moving forward, I see this photosensor-based power control as an impactful feature for low-power IoT devices. In the context of social awareness tools, this functionality could enhance the lifespan of devices in off-grid or resource-limited environments. As photosensors and other ambient sensors become more advanced, they could play a major role in developing energy-efficient systems that adapt seamlessly to their surroundings.
