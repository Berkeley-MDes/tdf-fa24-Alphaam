### Progress Report: Development of the **P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.** Project

**Day 1: Conceptualization & Initial Design**
- **Objective**: Begin the conceptualization and initial design phase for the project.
- **Tasks**:
  - Decided on a **flexible phone stand** concept based on personal pain points, such as pop socket incompatibility and wire organization issues.
  - Sketched out initial design ideas incorporating the nestling feature for the pop socket to allow multiple interaction angles.
- **Outcome**:
  - Finalized on a hybrid design combining circular elements and rigid structure for balance and functionality.
  - Set the challenge level to **Triceratops** due to the learning curve of managing both the master’s program and this new project.
  
**Day 2: Software Exploration (Fusion 360 & Grasshopper)**
- **Objective**: Explore 3D design software for creating the phone stand.
- **Tasks**:
  - Began experimenting with **Fusion 360** and **Grasshopper**.
  - Noticed a steeper learning curve with Grasshopper, so focused on developing the model in **Fusion 360** for immediate results.
  - Utilized AI tools (ChatGPT) to assist with design errors, especially around accurately measuring for the pop socket nestling feature.
- **Outcome**:
  - Drafted the first iteration of the design in Fusion, gaining insights into algorithmic thinking, especially the importance of **workflow order**.
  - Encountered challenges with dynamic positioning but identified potential solutions.

**Day 3: Refining the Design**
- **Objective**: Make necessary adjustments to the Fusion design for the pop socket stand.
- **Tasks**:
  - Adjusted the design for better balance and dynamic phone positioning.
  - Incorporated feedback from AI tools to solve design issues related to stability.
- **Outcome**:
  - Finalized a design ready for 3D printing.
  - Gained clarity on how to approach similar future projects, integrating the lessons learned from Grasshopper and Fusion.

**Day 4: 3D Printing and Prototyping**
- **Objective**: Print the phone stand prototype.
- **Tasks**:
  - Prepared the **Jessie PLA** material and set up the 3D printer.
  - Set print settings to **0.15mm** layer height for a faster print that still maintains quality.
  - Considered structural supports for the nestling feature due to potential print failures.
- **Outcome**:
  - Printed the prototype successfully within **1 hour and 59 minutes**.
  - Prototype demonstrated the intended functionality for phone charging and wire organization.

**Day 5: Testing and Feedback Gathering**
- **Objective**: Test the prototype and gather feedback.
- **Tasks**:
  - Tested the **nestling feature** with different phone sizes and orientations to ensure versatility.
  - Gathered peer feedback on both the product’s aesthetics and functionality.
- **Outcome**:
  - Positive feedback on the design, with suggestions for further refinement.
  - Noted the need for smoother surface finishes and more efficient wire management features.

**Day 6: Reflection & Documentation**
- **Objective**: Reflect on the project process and document key insights.
- **Tasks**:
  - Documented the design process, from initial sketches to final product.
  - Reflected on the challenges of balancing work, learning new software, and completing the project within a week.
  - Peer feedback was mostly positive, with suggestions to explore **Grasshopper** further in future projects.
- **Outcome**:
  - Identified future steps for design improvement, including recreating the design using **Grasshopper** and expanding the user base beyond personal needs.

**Day 7: Final Submission and Presentation**
- **Objective**: Prepare and submit the final project video and report.
- **Tasks**:
  - Created and uploaded a **project video** showcasing the phone stand’s features and usability.
  - Reflected on how using myself as the primary user helped in better identifying the pain points of phone interaction on a desk.
  - Highlighted the lessons learned in using **AI tools** for design iteration and troubleshooting.
- **Outcome**:
  - Submitted the final deliverables (design, documentation, and video).
  - Final project video: [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/Wxs-XB_21WQ?si=eagqO1GPVJAEbSVG).
