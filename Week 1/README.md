## PROJECTS

As the first week of classes focused mainly on introductions, I didn’t learn much in class. Instead, I spent the week orienting myself to the city and the resources available in my building. I completed all my required training and then began working on some MDes-related bucket list items.

One of these goals was to learn how to sew. While I haven’t had the opportunity to actually sew yet, I went fabric shopping and familiarized myself with the tools in the soft lab section of the makerspace. I’ve already identified my first project: a shirt for a dear friend.

This entire endeavor, along with my bucket list items, is meant to motivate me by providing specific directions on what to do and how to engage with the resources available to me in the Makerspace. It’s an effort to avoid repeating an unfortunate occurrence from my time as an undergrad, where I felt overwhelmed by the abundance of resources and possibilities, which left me feeling paralyzed and unable to fully learn everything I could.

Ultimately, through exploring tools and acquiring new skills, I hope to understand what I might want to pursue professionally.

Here are some pictures of my to-do list and the fabrics I bought.
