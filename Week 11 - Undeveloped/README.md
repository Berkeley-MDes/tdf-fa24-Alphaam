### TDF Final Project Progress Report 1

#### **Reflections**

**Conceptual Development:**
This week was dedicated to solidifying the foundation of my project, which aims to critique the fluidity and manipulation of cultural definitions, particularly in Tanzanian contexts. The project draws on my personal experiences and observations of how "culture" is used as a tool for exclusion. I explored how to visualize this critique through a medium inspired by Kitenge printsâ€”a culturally significant Tanzanian fabric with vibrant colors and intricate patterns.

Key questions guiding this week:
1. How can I accurately translate the complexity of Kitenge patterns into generative code?
2. How do I ensure the generated designs authentically represent the intricacies of Kitenge fabric?

**Exploration of Tools:**
I began researching tools and techniques for creating generative art that mimics Kitenge patterns:
- **p5.js**: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in generating geometric designs and dynamic visualizations.
- **Image analysis tools**: Explored ways to analyze Kitenge prints for dominant colors and patterns, using OpenCV and online color palette extraction tools like Colormind.

**Initial Coding Experiments:**
1. **Basic Shape Rendering**:
   - Experimented with simple geometric shapes (e.g., teardrops and circles) in p5.js to begin replicating common Kitenge patterns.
   - Introduced randomness to shape size and positioning to mimic the organic yet symmetrical feel of Kitenge designs.
2. **Color Integration**:
   - Started building a vibrant palette inspired by reference images of Kitenge prints, using extracted hex codes from online tools.
3. **Texture Exploration**:
   - Tested basic noise overlays to begin replicating the subtle fabric texture of printed Kitenge.

**Challenges:**
- Translating the intricate, layered patterns of Kitenge into a code-driven design while maintaining authenticity.
- Ensuring shapes appear seamlessly integrated rather than stacked on top of each other.

**State of Work:**
By the end of the week, I had:
- A draft p5.js script that generates basic teardrop shapes with random sizes and positions.
- An initial palette of vibrant colors inspired by Kitenge fabric.
- A plan for adding texture and refining the integration of shapes.

#### **Speculations**

**Future Tool Direction:**
- Tools like p5.js could benefit from better texture integration features, allowing generative artists to replicate complex material effects (e.g., fabric weaving) directly.

**Future Project Direction:**
- Focus next week on refining the patterns, particularly the integration of texture and the bleeding effect of black lines.
- Explore techniques to make the generated patterns more dynamic while maintaining the "Key Features" identified this week:
  - Kitenge texture.
  - Randomized shape position and size.
  - Bleeding black lines.
  - Saturation and vibrancy of colors.
  - Seamless integration of all shapes.
