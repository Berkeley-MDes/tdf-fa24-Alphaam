Weekly Progress Report - Week 1: 3D Enclosure Design and Prototyping
Reflections: This week, I focused on designing and prototyping the enclosure for the Palestinian Death Counter. Using 3D modeling software, I created the initial structure, iterating on multiple designs to achieve a compact, visually symbolic, and functional housing. The design had to account for precise placements of the OLED display, LEDs, photosensor, and battery components, ensuring accessibility and durability.

After finalizing the initial design, I proceeded with 3D printing. The first prototype revealed a few fit and alignment issues, particularly with the OLED and LED slots, which required slight modifications in the design file. This process taught me the importance of precise measurement and foresight in component placement when balancing functionality with aesthetics. The enclosure is now compact yet robust, with all necessary access points for interactive elements, and serves as a protective frame that reflects the serious tone of the project.

Speculations: Looking ahead, I envision further applications of 3D-printed enclosures tailored to emotionally charged, socially relevant tech projects. As 3D printing technology evolves, designers will have the opportunity to develop symbolic, functional housings for interactive devices, which could be customized to reflect various humanitarian issues. I also see the potential for using sustainable materials in 3D printing to align with social impact goals.
